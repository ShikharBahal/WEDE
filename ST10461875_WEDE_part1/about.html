                    <p>WorldWide Animal Protection was founded in 2007 by Adel Malan, who recognized the need for a wildlife trauma and rehabilitation center. Developer Rob Taylor sponsored the building of the WorldWide Animal Protection clinic, which opened its doors on the 1st of January 2008.</p>

                    <p>WorldWide Animal Protection (WWAP) is a leading wildlife rehabilitation center, admitting over 2000 patients annually. Known for its strict "hands-off" approach, WWAP ensures animals are neither tamed nor habituated, promoting natural wild behaviors. This policy is crucial for successful rehabilitation and reintegration.</p>

                <font size="4">
                    <p>WWAP has aided the recovery and release of 27 Endangered, Threatened, or Protected species. In 2019, they executed a major rescue operation, saving over 2000 Amur Falcons.</p>

                    <p>Collaborating with organizations like Wild Tomorrow and local Nature Reserves, WWAP focuses on conservation and species reintroduction. Their research initiatives, such as The Tortoise Project with A Rocha and Ezemvelo Wildlife, aim to reform laws and protocols for wildlife rehabilitation.</p>
