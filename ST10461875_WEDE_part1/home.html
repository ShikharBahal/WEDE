        <p>World Animal Protection (WAP) is a global non-profit organization dedicated to improving the welfare of animals worldwide. The organization campaigns against cruel practices in entertainment, such as the use of wild animals in circuses, marine parks, and roadside zoos, and works to improve the conditions in which farm animals are kept by promoting humane and sustainable farming practices. WAP also helps communities better care for their animals, especially pets and street animals, by providing veterinary services, vaccinations, and education on responsible pet ownership. Additionally, they assist in rescuing and providing relief to animals affected by natural disasters and work to end the illegal wildlife trade, advocating for the protection of wild animals in their natural habitats. Engaging with international bodies and governments, WAP influences global policy to create and enforce laws that protect animal welfare. The overall goal of World Animal Protection is to create a world where animals live free from suffering and exploitation, promoting their well-being and ensuring their protection through advocacy, education, and direct action.</p>
